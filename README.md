Repository for AIForBusiness NLP Use Cases

This is Hands On Exercise to processing Textual Data for Insights using NLP techniques.

DataSet :  Here we use Airline Tweets or Textual Comments / Statements made by Travellers / users.
Objective :  Our Objective is to classify tweets as positive or negative so that suitable business action can be taken based on classification.

Dataset Details : This dataset is as provided by Kaggle. The dataset has the following columns:

          tweet_id
          airline_sentiment
          airline_sentiment_confidence
          negativereason
          negativereason_confidence
          airline
          airline_sentiment_gold
          name
          negativereason_gold
          retweet_count
          text
          tweet_coord
          tweet_created
          tweet_location
          user_timezone

Few many Attribtues (or Columns or Features) of interest could be : airline_sentiment and text.

Hands-on Exercises to learn NLP
a) Lesson 01 NLP Warm-up:
   In this first Hands-on Exercise students will be able to work on various Text Processing concepts as it relates to NLP:
             - Reading Text documents
             - Manipulating Strings
             - NLTK Library 
             - Corpus, Language, Vocabulary
             - Tokenization
             - Regular Expressions and Patterns
             - Stop Words processing
             - Stemming
             - Lemmatization
             - Parts of Speech

b) Lesson 02 End to End NLP Example: Airline Sentiment Classification Case Study
   In this second lesson we will use a proper dataset to built a Classfication model on the back of NLP based text data processing.
    -  Data Acquistion
    -  Data Processing 
    -  Data Preparation using NLP concepts like Stop Words, Stemming etc.
